                <p> We are customer service oriented, and we also have a high level of technical expertise.
                    Our team is a group of tech-savvy professionals who focus on solving tricky technical issues.
                    All our personal have a degree in a tech-related field and relevant certifications which are 
                    required to be a support specialist. We have more than 20 years of experience offering solutions
                    to customers.</p>
                    <ul>
                     We provide three types of service:
                        <li>Local service desks are tied to a specific organization and are usually located at or near their office.</li>
                        <li>Centralized service desks serve a large region and several different clients. They tend to be their own entity instead of being tied to a specific business.</li>
                        <li>Virtual service desks employ remote staff across multiple locations and do not have a physical location. This is currently the most common model.</li>
