      <h3>Solutions and Services</h3>
    
      <p>
        We are customer service oriented, and we also have a high level of technical expertise. 
        Our team is a group of tech-savvy professionals who focus on solving tricky technical issues.
         All our personal have a degree in a tech-related field and relevant certifications which are 
         required to be<br> a support specialist. We have more than 20 years of experience offering 
         solutions to customers.<br>
        <br>We provide three types of service:<br>
        <br>•	Local service desks are tied to a specific organization and are usually located at or near their office.<br>
        •	Centralized service desks serve a large region and several different clients. They tend to be their own entity 
        instead of being tied to a specific business.<br>
        •	Virtual service desks employ remote staff across multiple locations and do not have a physical location. 
        This is currently the most common model.<br>

        Here is a list of the main services we offer: <br>
        •	Technical Support: Find a solution to the problem of the same, whether physical (hardware) or logical (software) 
        of any type of electronic device.<br>
        •	Fixing Equipment: Identifying malfunctioning components like RAM, hard drives, graphics cards, etc., through diagnostic 
        tools and visual inspection.<br>
        •	Replacement and Installation: Replacing faulty components with new ones, ensuring proper compatibility and functionality.<br>
        •	Server Installation: Select the server hardware, and operating system, choose a good location, configure it, and implement security.<br>
        •	Server Administration: Manage and secure company data and information.<br>
        •	Identify or Diagnose Problems: Process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving issues and errors in the computer system.<br>
        •	Server Maintenance: Keeping server software updated and running smoothly so that a computer network functions properly and avoids downtime 
        or loss of data.<br>
        •	Application Developments: Creating a computer program or a set of programs to perform the different tasks that a business requires. <br>
        •	Troubleshooting Problems: Define the problem, collect relevant information, analyze collected data, propose a solution, and test it. Finally,
         implement the solution.<br>
        •	Workstation Maintenance: Protect with padding, organize cords, update your operating system, unplug to avoid overcharging, purge your system 
        of junk files and programs, run regular antivirus scans, clean the keyboard and case, and update your passwords.<br>
        •	LAN performance: Identify and troubleshoot LAN connectivity issues, try to ping the destination IP, and check configuration settings and source 
        host.<br>
        •	General Backup: A copy of computer data taken and stored elsewhere so that it may be used to restore the original after a data loss event. <br>
        •	Purchasing Recommendation: Depends on the equipment. We can consider the amount of Memory (RAM), user reviews for longevity, whether the PC is for
         personal or business use, and processor used. For Laptops: case type, storage capacity, hard drive type, etc.<br>
